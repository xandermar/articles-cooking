## ðŸŒ¿ Crunchy Artisan Rosemary Bread

### **Ingredients** *(makes 1 round loaf)*

* 3 Â½ cups (420g) bread flour
* 1 Â½ tsp sea salt
* 1 Â½ tsp active dry yeast
* 1 Â½ cups (360ml) warm water (about 100Â°F / 38Â°C)

### **Instructions**

#### 1. **Mix the Dough (No Knead)**

In a large bowl, combine:

* Flour
* Salt
* Yeast
* Chopped rosemary

Add the warm water and olive oil. Stir with a wooden spoon until a shaggy, sticky dough forms.
**Do not knead.**

Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let it sit at **room temperature for 12 to 18 hours** (overnight). Dough should double in size and look bubbly.

#### 2. **Shape the Dough**

* Lightly flour a clean surface and your hands. Turn the dough out and fold it over itself a few times.
* Shape it into a rough ball and let it rest for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, place a **Dutch oven with lid** (or heavy oven-safe pot) in your oven and preheat to **450Â°F (232Â°C)**.

#### 3. **Second Rise**

* Place the dough on a piece of parchment paper.
* Cover with a towel and let rise 30 more minutes while the oven heats.

---

#### 4. **Bake**

* Carefully remove the hot Dutch oven.
* Use the parchment paper to transfer dough into the pot.
* Sprinkle extra rosemary and a pinch of sea salt on top if desired.
* Cover and bake for **30 minutes**.
* Remove the lid and bake an additional **12â€“15 minutes**, until golden brown and crisp.

---

#### 5. **Cool & Serve**

* Remove from pot and let cool on a rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing.

---

### **Tips**

* For extra crunch, mist the inside of the oven with water when removing the lid.
* Add roasted garlic or Kalamata olives for variation.
* Store wrapped in a clean towel at room temp for 2â€“3 days.
