### **Instructions**

#### 1. **Make the Dough (24–72 hrs in advance)**

1. In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, sugar, and yeast.
2. Add warm water and olive oil. Mix until dough forms.
3. Knead for 7–10 minutes until smooth and elastic (or use stand mixer with dough hook).
4. Lightly oil a bowl, place the dough in, and cover tightly.
5. Let rise in the fridge **for at least 24 hours**, ideally 48–72 hours for best flavor.

#### 2. **Make the Sauce**

1. In a saucepan over medium heat, sauté garlic in olive oil until fragrant (about 1 min).
2. Add crushed tomatoes, sugar, salt, oregano, and red pepper flakes.
3. Simmer uncovered for 15–20 minutes. Let cool.

#### 3. **Shape the Dough**

1. Remove dough from the fridge 1 hour before baking.
2. Preheat oven to **500°F (260°C)** or as hot as it goes. Place pizza stone or steel in oven if using.
3. On a floured surface, gently stretch dough into a 14–16" circle—thin in center, thicker at edge.

#### 4. **Assemble the Pizza**

1. Transfer dough to a pizza peel or parchment if using a stone/steel.
2. Spread ½–¾ cup sauce thinly over the dough.
3. Sprinkle mozzarella evenly over top.
4. Optional: add grated parmesan or a few basil leaves.

#### 5. **Bake**

1. Slide onto preheated stone/steel or bake on a pizza pan.
2. Bake for 7–10 minutes until crust is browned and cheese is bubbling.
3. Broil for 1 minute if needed to brown the cheese.

#### 6. **Finish & Serve**

* Let rest 1–2 minutes.

* Fold, bite, and enjoy like a true New Yorker.
