Here's a simple recipe to make **soft and fluffy 4-inch hamburger buns** at home:

---

### 🍔 **Ingredients (makes about 8 buns):**

* 3/4 cup warm water (110°F / 43°C)
* 2 tablespoons warm milk
* 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (plus more for kneading)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
* 1 egg (for dough)
* 1 egg + 1 tablespoon water (for egg wash)
* Optional: sesame seeds

---

### 🔧 **Equipment:**

* Baking sheet
* 4-inch round cookie cutter or ring mold (for uniform size – optional)
* Parchment paper

---

### 🥣 **Instructions:**

#### 1. **Activate the yeast:**

In a small bowl, combine:

* 3/4 cup warm water
* 2 tablespoons warm milk
* 2 teaspoons yeast
* 2 tablespoons sugar

Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.

#### 2. **Make the dough:**

In a large bowl or stand mixer bowl:

* Add 2 1/2 cups flour
* Add 1 teaspoon salt
* Add 1 egg and 2 tablespoons softened butter

Pour in the foamy yeast mixture. Mix until a shaggy dough forms, then knead for 6–8 minutes (or 4–5 minutes in a mixer) until smooth and elastic.

#### 3. **First rise:**

Cover the bowl with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place for **1–1.5 hours** or until doubled.

#### 4. **Shape into 4-inch buns:**

Punch down the dough and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll each into a ball. Flatten slightly to about **4 inches wide**.

Place buns on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them at least 1.5 inches apart.

💡 *Tip: Use a 4" biscuit cutter or mold to press and shape for perfect size.*

#### 5. **Second rise:**

Cover loosely and let rise for another **45 minutes** until puffy.

#### 6. **Apply egg wash & toppings:**

Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon water. Brush over each bun for a golden finish. Add sesame seeds if desired.

#### 7. **Bake:**

Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
Bake for **15–18 minutes** or until golden brown.

#### 8. **Cool:**

Let buns cool on a wire rack before slicing.

### ✅ **Optional Adjustments:**

* Add 1 tablespoon olive oil for a slightly different flavor.
* Substitute half the flour with bread flour for chewier texture.
