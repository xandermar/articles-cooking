### **Instructions**

1. **Prepare the Cream Mixture:**

   * In a heatproof bowl, whisk egg yolks and sugar together.
   * Place over a double boiler (or simmering pot of water) and whisk continuously for 8–10 minutes until thick and pale. Remove from heat and let cool.
   * In a separate bowl, whip heavy cream to stiff peaks.
   * Gently fold mascarpone into the egg mixture until smooth.
   * Then fold in whipped cream gently until fully incorporated.

2. **Prepare the Coffee Mixture:**

   * Combine espresso, coffee liqueur, and vanilla extract in a shallow bowl. Let cool completely.

3. **Assemble the Tiramisu:**

   * Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture (about 1 second per side — do not soak).
   * Arrange a single layer in the bottom of a 9x13 inch (23x33 cm) dish.
   * Spread half of the cream mixture over the ladyfingers.
   * Repeat with a second layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining cream.

4. **Chill:**

   * Cover and refrigerate for at least **6 hours** (preferably overnight) to set and develop flavor.

5. **Serve:**

   * Just before serving, dust generously with cocoa powder.
   * Optionally top with dark chocolate shavings or curls.

### **Tips**

* **Do not use sweetened whipped topping** (like Cool Whip); it changes the texture and flavor.
* Use **freshly brewed espresso** for the richest flavor.
* **Overnight chilling** is best — tiramisu tastes better the next day.
