## **Classic Sourdough Bread Recipe**

### **Ingredients**

#### *Levain (Starter Feed)*

* 1 tablespoon active sourdough starter
* 60g (¼ cup) warm water
* 60g (½ cup) bread flour

#### *Dough*

* 500g (4 cups) bread flour
* 350g (1½ cups) water (filtered, room temp)
* 10g (1¾ tsp) fine sea salt
* All of the levain (once active)

---

### **Instructions**

#### **1. Make the Levain (Night Before Baking)**

In a small bowl, mix the starter, warm water, and flour. Cover loosely and leave at room temperature overnight (8–12 hours) until bubbly and doubled.

---

#### **2. Mix Dough (Morning)**

* In a large bowl, mix the flour and water until fully combined (it’ll be shaggy).
* Cover and let rest (autolyse) for 1 hour.
* Add the levain and mix well.
* Add the salt and mix again. Dough will be sticky—that’s normal.

---

#### **3. Bulk Fermentation & Folds (4–5 hours)**

* Leave dough at room temp, covered with a damp towel.
* Every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours, do a **stretch and fold**:
  Grab one side, stretch it up, and fold over. Rotate bowl and repeat 4 times.
* After 3–4 folds, let the dough rise untouched until it has grown \~50%.

---

#### **4. Shape & Rest**

* Lightly flour your surface. Turn dough out and shape into a tight round.
* Let rest uncovered for 20 minutes.
* Then do a final shape and place into a lightly floured banneton or bowl, seam-side up.

---

#### **5. Final Proof (1–2 hours at room temp or overnight in fridge)**

* Cover and let rise until puffy but not over-proofed.
* OR refrigerate overnight for a stronger flavor and better crust.

---

#### **6. Preheat Oven & Bake**

* Place Dutch oven inside your oven and preheat to **475°F (245°C)** for 30–45 minutes.
* Take dough from fridge (if cold-proofed), score the top with a razor or sharp knife.
* Place into hot Dutch oven, cover, and bake:

  * **20 min covered**
  * **25–30 min uncovered** until golden and crackling.

---

#### **7. Cool Completely**

Let the bread cool for at least **1 hour** before slicing—this helps set the crumb.

---

### **Tips**

* Use **filtered or dechlorinated water**—chlorine can kill your starter.
* A **wet dough is normal** in sourdough. Don’t over-flour.
* Use **rice flour** in your proofing basket to prevent sticking.
